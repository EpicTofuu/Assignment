# Language character distribution packs
The chi algorithm included in decryption is built entirely on external files meaning various languages can be supported. Currently, English, French and Japanese are supported however it is very easy to include other language files. To do so:

1) Create a txt with the language name (eg "German.txt")
2) Input the character first, then the frequency underneath eg,

    A
    6.9
    èµ¤
    2.1

UTF-8 files are supported
3) Comments can be made by adding an equal sign to the start eg "= This is a comment"
